Tried Elastic search today, really cool!
Brew is awesome!

Followed this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22850247/installing-elasticsearch-on-osx-mavericks

Two commands get it done:
brew update
brew install elasticsearch

then type
curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/
you could see it up! Nice!
